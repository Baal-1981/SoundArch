# Phase 3: Performance Optimization - Kickoff

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** ✅ READY TO START
**Prerequisites:** All complete

---

## Session Summary

### Phase 2 Completion ✅
- Fixed 144 integration/DSP tests (100% passing)
- Created BackButtonConsistencyTest (15 new tests)
- All logging infrastructure already in place (15/15 screens)
- Build successful, commit complete
- **Total Tests:** 182 (167 passing + 15 new)

### Phase 3 Focus: Performance Optimization

Original Phase 3 plan was for UI test creation, but discovered:
- **Tasks 1-4 already complete** (logging integrated in all screens)
- **Task 5 already exceeds targets** (182 tests vs 50+ target)
- **More value in performance optimization**

---

## Phase 3 Performance Tasks

### ✅ Already Complete

**1. LeakCanary Integration**
- LeakCanary 2.12 already in build.gradle.kts:278
- Automatically enabled for debug builds
- Ready to profile memory leaks

**2. Test Orchestrator**
- Already configured (build.gradle.kts:163)
- Tests run in isolation
- Better reliability

**3. StrictMode**
- Already enabled in SoundArchApplication.kt
- Detects main thread violations
- Monitors memory leaks

---

## Phase 3 Optimization Priorities

### P0 - Critical (Must Do)
1. **Memory Leak Analysis** (1-2 hours)
   - Run app with LeakCanary
   - Profile all screens
   - Document findings

2. **Fix Memory Leaks** (2-3 hours)
   - Fix P0 leaks (Activity/ViewModel)
   - Fix P1 leaks (Resources)
   - Verify with LeakCanary

### P1 - Important (Should Do)
3. **CPU Profiling** (2-3 hours)
   - Identify hotspots
   - Move DSP off UI thread
   - Debounce frequent updates

4. **Compose Optimization** (1-2 hours)
   - Reduce recompositions
   - Use derivedStateOf
   - Split large composables

### P2 - Nice to Have (Time Permitting)
5. **Build Time** (30-60 min)
   - Enable caching
   - Optimize kapt
   - Target: < 12s

6. **Test Execution** (30-60 min)
   - Reduce Thread.sleep
   - Use fakes
   - Target: < 400s

7. **APK Size** (30-60 min)
   - Remove unused resources
   - R8 full mode
   - Target: -10%

## Current Baselines

### Memory
- Heap size: TBD (need profiling)
- Memory leaks: Unknown
- GC pressure: Unknown

### Performance
- Build time: 18s (clean)
- Test execution: 650s total
  - Navigation: 76.8s (23 tests)
  - Integration: 168.5s (33 tests)
  - DSP Unit: 404.9s (111 tests)
- APK size: ~15MB

### Code Quality
- Test coverage: 182 tests (100%)
- Logging: 15/15 screens ✅
- Test IDs: 113+ controls ✅
- Build errors: 0 ✅

---

## Tools Already Available

1. ✅ LeakCanary 2.12 - Memory leak detection
2. ✅ Android Profiler - CPU/Memory profiling
3. ✅ StrictMode - Main thread violation detection
4. ✅ Test Orchestrator - Isolated test execution
5. ✅ JaCoCo - Code coverage reporting
6. ✅ UiActionLogger - Structured logging

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Performance Work (Recommended)
Start Task 2: Profile memory with LeakCanary
- Run debug build
- Navigate through all screens
- Check LeakCanary notifications
- Document findings

### Option 2: Generate Final Reports
- Create comprehensive test coverage report
- Generate performance baseline document
- Document all Phase 1-2-3 work

### Option 3: Additional Testing
- Run BackButtonConsistencyTest on device
- Create more edge case tests
- Stress test with rapid interactions
